Talon,Weston?,Male_16_T
Weston,"You must be um… Actually, I don’t think Anaset told me your name.",Male_17_R
Talon,"Over comms? Yeah, she probably wouldn’t. She’s smarter than that. Call me Talon.",Male_16_T
Weston,Okay. Talon. She said you could fix up my ship?,Male_17_R
Talon,"Absolutely. But not out of the kindness of my heart. Usually, you have a part of a deal to uphold.",Male_16_T
Weston,She never mentioned—,Male_17_R
Talon,"First time working with a Junker, huh? She told me you were green and for reasons unknown to me, she cares very much about your survival.",Male_16_T
Talon,Me? Not as much. You’ll find Junkers at stations here and there. We have a host of skills that the top brass claim they have via official channels.,Male_16_T
Talon,We on the other hand work through unofficial channels. Nothing we do touches the comm-waves nor are tracked in package delivery relays.,Male_16_T
Weston,"In short, totally off grid.",Male_17_R
Talon,"Mostly off grid. Junkers work off of a integrity system of sorts. We have our own encrypted ways of communication meaning, Junkers far and wide will know when a deal is made.",Male_16_T
Talon,"But what’s important to you is that they know WHO made the deal and let’s just keep it simple by saying, we got each other’s back. Call it an insurance plan to project us from being taken advantage of. You understand don’t you?",Male_16_T
Weston,"Yeah. Make a deal, follow through.",Male_17_R
Talon,It’s in the best interest of all of us.,Male_16_T
Talon,"Just so you know, she covered your part of the deal on this first one so I’ll fix up your ship and you won’t gotta do a thing.",Male_16_T
Weston,She did? Why?,Male_17_R
Talon,"Don’t know, don’t care. Just holding up my end of the deal.",Male_16_T
Talon,"If you’re ever in a pinch and don’t mind working through alternative means, seek out a Junker at a station. Usually get you what you need far cheaper than official means or even for free. Just gotta work out a deal. ",Male_16_T
Weston,Thanks. I appreciate it.,Male_17_R
