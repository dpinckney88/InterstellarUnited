WESTON,"I’m here. So, what are--",WESTON
ANASET,Hold on.,ANASET
WESTON,Um...?,WESTON
ANASET,There!,ANASET
TALON,We’re good.,TALON
WESTON,W-who are--Anaset?!,WESTON
TALON,I’m Talon.,TALON
ANASET,He’s Talon.,ANASET
WESTON,"Yeah. I heard. By WHO is he? WHY is he, even?",WESTON
TALON,Anaset patched me in via a sub-network. We piggy back off of the official station connection but our voice goes through encrypted and sounds like static over the line to anyone not looking close enough.,TALON
TALON,And officials don’t ever look close enough when it matters.,TALON
WESTON,Great. Love it. Thanks. Why are you here?,WESTON
ANASET,"Uh. Well. Um... Whatever--quick like a band-aid. Don’t be mad but, Talon’s a Junker.",ANASET
WESTON,A Junker?! Interstellar doesn’t seem the type to work with anyone that isn’t above board.,WESTON
TALON,"Buddy, they work with folks well below board. They just don’t work with Junkers. We’re too known by the general public.",TALON
ANASET,"We can go over this later, but Talon is gonna recharge your ship--free of charge because he owes me. But I owe Hatchet so, we’re going to need you to deliver this package.",ANASET
WESTON,And who is Hatchet?,WESTON
TALON,"Time is of the essence, so you’re on the clock with this one.",TALON
ANASET,We can’t have ISU getting curious so I secured another on the record package that needs to go to the same station where Hatchet is at. Everything should look status-quo on the record and travel logs.,ANASET
WESTON,Meaning Hatchet’s package isn’t on the record?,WESTON
TALON,Not if we did our job right.,TALON
WESTON,I don’t know about this. ,WESTON
ANASET,"I promise, I’ll answer any question you have but we need you to go. Now.",ANASET
TALON,"I’m gonna top you off, load up your ship and then you’re gonna fly to Portharbor. It’s station 236. You dock, you call Anaset, and she’ll patch you through to Hatchet. Got it?",TALON
WESTON,Do I have choice?,WESTON
TALON,"Everyone’s gotta choice, bud. Question is if you can handle the consequence.",TALON
