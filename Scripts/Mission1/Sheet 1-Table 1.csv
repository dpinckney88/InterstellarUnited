Anaset,Alright. Looks like we got your ship registered. Space stations should now automatically recognize you and allow you within the safe zone without issue and permit you to dock.,Female_09_R
Weston,Do all stations have safe zones out here?,Male_17_R
Anaset,Yes. Well. No. Most do. ,Female_09_R
Weston,Most?,Male_17_R
Anaset,The ones you’ll be docking at will be. We have more than our fair share of Celophons out here. Stations are more than just convenient docking structures for refueling like in other sectors—they’re homes and communities.,Female_09_R
Anaset,A comprable defense system is needed to help keep everyone safe.,Female_09_R
Weston,"Uh. Sure, makes sense for the deadly alien bugs, but a community that keeps all ships out that don’t have a docking pass?",Male_17_R
Anaset,"Sounds extreme but, Celophons aren’t the only danger out in these sectors.",Female_09_R
Weston,S-should I be worried?,Male_17_R
Anaset,Stay near the stations and you should be fine.,Female_09_R
Weston,Should?!,Male_17_R
Anaset,"For now, let’s just worry about getting a delivery on the books. I got a notification of package at this station that needs to get to Kalloway Station—station ID KS8201.",Female_09_R
Anaset,Let’s get on that and I’ll secure some more packages for delivery.,Female_09_R
Weston,"Sure. If I don’t die in the process, I’ll radio you when the package is delivered.",Male_17_R
Anaset,No need. I’ll get notified on delivery.,Female_09_R
Anaset,…And on your untimely demise.,Female_09_R
Weston,"Oh! Well, isn’t that great.",Male_17_R
